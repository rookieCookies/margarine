# butter, the why & the how
## The why
Nowadays it almost feels like all game engines are **carbon copies** of eachother with extremely miniscule change,
while this does allow the engines to be a lot more approachable as it's basically the same game engine with a
different colour it's hard to argue that we've perfected game engine design. So why **not** make a radical change
and improve your development experience **tenfold**.


## The how
The butter game engine adopts ECS architecture to the very core of the engine. Everything is built around ECS.  
This structure that is built around ECS is supported with an extremely easy-to-use and fast language made for
butter, `margarine`.



# Okay, that's cool and all but why would I switch?
butter adopts a significantly different structure and development experience compared to traditional OOP based
engines (think of Unity, Godot, etc.) These changes allow you, the developer, to make much more extendable,
maintainable, and performant code while also being easier to write than many other game engines.


# Cross-platform compatibility
All butter games eventually compile to highly-optimised WASM, this means that your game can run on any Windows,
Linux, Mac machine natively while also being able to seamlessly run on the web itself just from a single game file.
Supporting all platforms is as easy as you not doing anything at all.


# One last thing...
Ever thought of how you'd make your game modding-friendly? butter, the game engine, provides a modding API for
modders which gives your game an extreme amount of modding support without you having to lift a finger.  
Now, would you be so opposed to try out the engine in your browser? (not released yet hehe, but this will be a clickable link when it is)
